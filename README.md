This project is built using Next.js [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and it was initialized with the create-next-app CLI tool [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To begin development, launch the local server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your preferred browser to view the application.

You can begin making changes by editing the `app/page.tsx` file. Any modifications will reflect automatically as the app supports live reloading.

This setup includes the [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) utility, which helps efficiently load and optimize [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), Vercelâ€™s proprietary font family.
